        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>

Any dispute relating to the Terms or the Site may be litigated only in a court having jurisdiction and venue in Lane County for state court causes of action and in the District of Oregon for federal court causes of action.

          The Terms are accepted upon your use of the Site or any of its features. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and 10Ray regarding the use of Site and its services and features. The failure of 10Ray to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of the Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from the Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
