        </div>
        <p>The future is coming. Some would say the future is already here. In
          either case, artificial intelligence is at the center of this debate.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence promises many things. It promises faster
          decision making, more accurate measurements, the elimination of
          tedious and intensive tasks, and, of course, the fuel behind most
          sci-fi movies, human-like robots.</p>
        <p>Although we're not to the point where robots could walk and live
          among us (though <a href="https://youtu.be/S5t6K9iwcdw" target="_blank">this video</a>
          shows that is a work in progress),
          artificial intelligence does exist today in the form of machine
          learning algorithms that are theorized to change the way we work and
          the solutions companies implement for major challenges. This means
          that artificial intelligence could be working alongside people in the
          jobs they do today to make them simpler or faster or potentially take
          over the job altogether. The latter theory is one of the reasons
          artificial intelligence has many people worried.</p>
        <p>Unlike in previous periods of technological change that have affected
          jobs (e.g. the industrial revolution), this change will come quickly
          and effect all jobs from hourly workers to CEO.</p>
        <p>Today, artificial intelligence is developed enough to cover 21% of a
          doctor's responsibilities, 15% of a financial planner's responsibilities, and 20% of a journalist's responsibilities
          (watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/aKm_ZtUSbC0" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Race</a>
          documentary here to learn more
          about these stats. Originally aired in Australia on ABC.) Companies
          from all over the globe are stepping up
          to continue to improve these statistics and provide new solutions to
          today's problems through artificial intelligence, and although there
          are many hesitant to improve A.I., the artificial intelligence movement
          is well underway.</p>
        <p>In order for companies big and small to prepare for the changes, it's
          important to understand where artificial intelligence may impact your
          company. The A.I. solutions available today (from medical scheduling
          to social media advertising) may not solve your immediate problems or
          fit your budget but that day is coming. Although no role is excluded
          from being affected or improved by A.I., the more formulaic roles may
          have to evolve the fastest.</p>
        <p>For the companies who want to prepare for the future, 10Ray is here -
          helping you set the foundation for Analytics and Social Media for
          whatever comes next.</p>
