        <p>
          This website is owned and operated by 10Ray, a business headquartered
          in Eugene, Oregon USA. This includes www.10ray.com and additional 10Ray
          produced and managed websites (together, the “Site”). Each time that
          you access or use the Site you signify that you have read, understand
          and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do
          not agree to the Terms of Use and this Policy, you must discontinue
          using our Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          10Ray takes user privacy very seriously because we know that your privacy
          on the web is important to you. 10Ray has implemented generally accepted
          standards of technology in order to protect your personally identifiable
          information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. However,
          10Ray cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access
          to your personally identifiable information. 10Ray reserves the right, at
          its sole discretion, to alter and update this Privacy Policy from time to
          time; therefore, we urge visitors to our Site to review the current
          version of the Privacy Policy each time they return to our Site. The
          date of the more recent update is reflected at the bottom of this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you request information from 10Ray and/or supply information through
          the Site that personally identifies you and/or allows us to contact you
          including any and all materials submitted by you in connection with
          applying to 10Ray for employment, including but not limited to, when
          you fill out a contact form or fill out a consulting inquiry, you are
          agreeing to share such information, including your name, e-mail address,
          title, occupation, company or university affiliation, industry, region,
          relationship to 10Ray, reason for contacting 10Ray, and any message you
          submit, with 10Ray, its agents, representatives and affiliates, and you
          should know that 10Ray may disclose such information to its agents,
          representatives and affiliates for marketing and promotional purposes.
          10Ray may aggregate personally identifiable information and may disclose
          such information in aggregate for marketing and promotional purposes.
          However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any
          information that could be used to personally identify you. We may collect
          the e-mail addresses of those who send us e-mail messages; however, we
          will not send unsolicited e-mail to any of the addresses we collect or
          share those addresses with any unaffiliated third party, except in the
          limited circumstances set forth below. We may disclose personal
          information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief
          that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with law or comply with
          legal process served upon us or our agents, representatives and affiliates,
          (2) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users or
          (3) protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use cookies or other technology to obtain certain types of
          information when your web browser accesses our Site. "Cookies" are
          small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your
          computer's hard drive. Our Site may use cookies and other technology
          to store pertinent user information during a session to speed navigation
          and keep track of items and to collect anonymous traffic data that we
          may use to enhance our Site and for marketing and promotional purposes.
          The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to
          prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
          notify you when you receive new cookies, and how to disable cookies
          altogether.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you may disclose
          publicly in any chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages, including
          those linked to our Site. You should keep in mind that whenever you publicly
          disclose information about yourself online—for example, via message boards
          or chat rooms—that information could be collected and used by people whom
          you do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user
          forums may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and
          message. 10Ray bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any
          third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the
          message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Site is not directed at children 13 years of age or younger. 10Ray,
          therefore, will not intentionally collect information about anyone under
          the age of 13, and requests that no such information be submitted to us.
