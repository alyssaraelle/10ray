          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Today most businesses have a website where they either sell their
            product or advertise their business. This digital store front may
            have made it easier to reach people from all over the world, but
            it’s made it harder to gauge a person’s reaction to your business and
            to know what brought someone to your digital store in the first place.</p>
          <h2>Big Business Solution</h2>
          <p>Luckily, reporting tools came along and made it possible to understand the
            interactions people had with your website and where visitors of your site came from.
            However, getting insights from these interactions that could improve
            your business usually involved calling in experts. First, you had to
            get someone who knew how to set up the reporting tool correctly. Then
            you had to get someone who knew what interactions were most important
            to your business and how to evaluate them.</p>
